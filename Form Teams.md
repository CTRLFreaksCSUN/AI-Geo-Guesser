For this milestone you will

Have your first group meeting.

Figure out how you will get organized, what your team name will be.

Agree on a general description of what your app will do.

At your first team meeting you should:

-Exchange contact information with everyone on your team: for both standard messaging (email) and emergency situations (phone #).

-Determine a time for team meetings that is agreeable to everyone on the team.

-Choose your chat service: slackLinks to an external site., teamsLinks to an external site., google chat Links to an external site etc. Important discussions should be recorded in your GitHub Issues, for example: which backend should we use? The online chat is for more informal or organizational discussions: should we meet next Thursday?

-Discuss options, approaches, etc. What will be your project? How will you built it? You will also have to soon choose, but not required for this Milestone (it might be too early to make some of these decisions):

-Platform: Android, django, iOS, react native, etc.

-IDE: Xcode, WebStorm, VSCode, etc. Note that modern IDEs now have built-in methods for sharing your editor view with teammates: code togetherLinks to an external site., code with meLinks to an external site., etc.

-Backend: firebase, postgresql, not needed, etc.

-Libraries

-APIs you will access

-Package manager: npm, yarn, gradle, etc.

Discuss what each one of you wants from this project. Do you want to learn a particular technology (Android, django, etc.)? Do you want to Design an app? Do you want to focus on a particular part of the technology stack (fronted, backend, Design, database, IT, git, testing, etc.)?

Select roles and designate responsibilities for all team members. Everyone on the team is expected to contribute to each part of the project. The assigned roles simply indicate how the work involved in various tasks might be distributed. Possible roles are:

-Project Manager: direct meetings

-Editor: collect, assemble, edit, and format data and wiki pages

-User Experience: takes on the user's perspective

-Tester

-Database Developer

-Application Developer

-Lead Architect

-Researcher: research possible libraries;

-Repo master: helps everyone setup their git.

-Master of a specific technology: Android Studio, django, firebase, etc.

-Optimist, Pessimist, Analyst: advocate, challenge, analyze ideas.

Deliverables:

-Set you real name in your GitHub profileLinks to an external site., or at least your first name, if possible.

-On your github repo, add all of this semester's ASSIGNMENTS as assignments in your github Issues. Set the correct due date on them. Make them look similar to theseLinks to an external site..

-Add a wiki page (or more) to your repo titled "Team Organization" and list there the decisions you made on the questions 2,3, and 4 above, along with any pother pertinent information for the team. Note that you will be turning in many of the early Milestones as wiki pages, so think about how you will organize your wiki.

-Add a page to your wiki titled "Project Description" which should be kept updated as you make decisions about your project. It should contain these sections:
  
-Description: a short description of your project,

-Technologies: a list of the technologies you plan to use: frameworks, libraries, hosting services, etc.

-Client: your client's name and contact info, if you have one, otherwise just say "Startup."
