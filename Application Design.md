For this milestone your group will work out in detail the design of your app. You will use a diagramming tool like Pencil, figma, justinmind, balsamiq, mockflow.com, or just your favorite paint program . If you are building a game or other widget-free app then a paint program will be easier to use.

Your design should include:

1. Screens and Dialogs:

-Create an image for each major screen and dialog in your app.

-Show all widgets in their proper placement.

-Name each screen and provide text explaining how actions on one screen lead to other screens.

2. Widget-Free Apps:

-Include diagrams for all major ‘areas’.

-Provide animation stills detailing common animations

-Use storyboards if they are more relevant to your game.

Goals of the Design:

-Usability: Think about the usability of your app. Simulate how a user might interact with it. A common method is to print the screens on sheets of paper of the correct size and shuffle them as you pretend to use the app.

-Efficiency: Save time by making changes now. Adding or deleting a screen is much easier at this stage than after you’ve written the code.
